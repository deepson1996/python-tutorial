# Problem 1 Sum
a = 5
b = 3
sum = a + b
print("sum of a and b is ", sum)

# Problem 2 Remainder
remainder = a % b
print("remainder of a / b is ", remainder)

# Problem 3 Type of the variable assigned with input
# i = input("Enter the value to know type of: ")
# print("Type of a is ", type(i)) 
# always string as the input function always returns string

# Problem 4 # Greater than
print("The statement a is grater than b is ", a > b)

# Problem 5 # average of two numbers entered by user

first = input("Enter first number: ")
second = input("Enter second number: ")

average = (int(first)+int(second))/2 # needs to be typecasted to integer

print("The average value of first and second number is ", average)

#Problem 6 #Calculate square of number entered by user
number = input("Enter the number to calculate square: ")
number = int(number)
print("The square of number is ", number**2) # ** is valid ^ is not
